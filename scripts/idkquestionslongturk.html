                            <p><strong>Why these are BAD responses: </strong></p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>(1) - (3) are not bad on their own but are just slight rewordings of each other, all have nearly exactly the same format/meaning, and <strong>show no variety or creativity</strong> and <strong>are not long enough</strong>. We expect you to provide us with four unique and varying customer service requests that are <strong>at least 15 words long</strong>.</li>
                                <li>While (4) is a unique question and long enough, it is just small talk and does not represent a task/question that would be asked of a customer service agent.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                </ol>

                <p>We try to do our best to pay turkers fairly, giving time to think about the task and submit reasonable responses. Individuals who try and exploit the task by submitting empty, incomplete, or lots of bad responses will NOT have their work approved. Don&#39;t worry about this if you are putting in a normal amount of thought/effort! We appreciate your help and please leave feedback if you have any thoughts or comments!</p>
