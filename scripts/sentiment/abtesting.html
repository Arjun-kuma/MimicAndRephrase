        <p>This tasks involves some creativity. Please read the instructions carefully.
          <strong>It is important to read all instructions to be able to produce a response that will not be rejected.</strong>
          Expect to spend around 1.5 min per HIT</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Imagine you are engaging in a dialogue with someone and have just expressed either a positive or negative emotional sentiment.</li>
          <li>You will be tasked with choosing which of two responses is most appropriate for the given emotional sentiment.</li>
          <li>You should pick the response that seems most <strong>fluent</strong> and <strong>appropriate</strong> in response.</li>
          <li>Ignore the fact that many responses have incorrect capitalization and randomly interjected spaces.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Example of what to pick: (Please read)</strong>

        <ol>

          <div>


            <ol>
              <li><strong>Sentiment: </strong>I got a raise today. <br/>

                <strong>Response 1: </strong> i am happy about your raise. <br/>
                <strong>Response 2: </strong> i am happy raise. <br/>
                <strong>Response 1 is correct </strong> in this scenario as both responses address the sentiment correctly but only response 1 uses proper English.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Sentiment: </strong>I was involved in a minor car accident and now my insurance will go up.<br/>
                <strong>Response 1: </strong> i am sorry to hear that you were involved in a minor car accident and now your insurance will go up.<br/>
                <strong>Response 2: </strong> i am sorry to hear about your insurance going up<br/>
                <strong>Response 2 is correct.</strong> While both responses are proper in grammar and English, response 2 feels less wordy and more of a fluent response.
              </li>

              <li><strong>Sentiment: </strong> My raise was less than I expected. <br/>
                <strong>Response 1: </strong> i am sorry your raise was less than you expected.<br/>
                <strong>Response 2: </strong> i am sorry about your raise.<br/>
                <strong>Response 1 is correct.</strong> While both responses are fluent, response 1 most directly addresses the main concern of the sentiment.
              </li>
            </ol>

        <p>We try to do our best to pay turkers fairly, giving time to think about the task and submit reasonable responses. Individuals who try and exploit the task by submitting empty, incomplete, or lots of bad responses will NOT have their work approved. Don&#39;t worry about this if you are putting in a normal amount of thought/effort! We appreciate your help and please leave feedback if you have any thoughts or comments!</p>
