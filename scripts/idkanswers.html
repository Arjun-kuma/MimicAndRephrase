        <p>This tasks involves some creativity. Please read the instructions carefully.
          <strong>It is important to read all instructions to be able to produce a response that will not be rejected.</strong>
          Expect to spend around 1.5 min per HIT</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Imagine you are a customer service agent for some company (possibly retail, insurance, shipping, etc).</li>
          <li>Given a question that could be asked of such a customer service agent, you are expected to give a response indicating you <strong>
            do not know how to help
          </strong> or have no knowledge of what the customer is asking.</li>
          <li>Duplicate as much of the original sentence (words, phrases, structure) as possible in your response. Acronyms, abreviations, spelling, and phrasing should be kept <strong>exactly the same</strong> if possible. (i.e. AmEx should not be changed to American Express in the response)</li>
          <li>Your response <strong>must</strong> start with <strong>exactly</strong> one of the prefixes <strong>I do not know</strong> or <strong>I am not able to</strong>, whichever sounds most natural. (i.e. 'I do not know' for questions asking for information and 'I am not able to' for a request to do something). You <strong>cannot</strong> rephrase or change these prefixes in any way.</li>
          <li>Your response should be <strong>grammatically correct</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Example of GOOD responses: (Please read)</strong>

        <ol>

          <div>


            <ol>
              <li><strong>Original Question: </strong>What time does the bank open today? <br/>

                <strong>Response: </strong> I do not know what time the bank opens today.</li>
              <li><strong>Original Question: </strong>Please check on my order. <br/>

                <strong>Response: </strong> I am not able to check on your order.</li>
              <li><strong>Original Question: </strong>Can you delay my subscription to start next month instead of this month?<br/>

                <strong>Response: </strong> I am not able to delay your subscription.</li>
              <li><strong>Original Question: </strong>What features does your new line of products offer?<br/>

                <strong>Response: </strong> I do not know what features our new line of products offer.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Why these are GOOD responses: </strong>
            <ul>
              <li>They all start with one of the <strong>correct prefixes</strong>.
              <li>They are all <strong>very similar to the original questions</strong> but still <strong>sound natural</strong> and like what an actual customer service agent could say.</li>
              <li>(3) chose to shorten the original content of the question in the response because that sounded most natural which is fine - it is sometimes acceptable to simplify things to sound more natural as long as <strong>no extra unecessary words not in the original question are added</strong></li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <ol>

          <div>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Original Question: </strong>Please check on my order. <br/>

                <strong>Response: </strong> I cannot check on your order.</li>
              <li><strong>Original Question: </strong>What time does the bank open today? <br/>

                <strong>Response: </strong> I am not able to access information about the hours of operation for the bank.</li>
              <li><strong>Original Question: </strong>Can you delay my subscription to start next month instead of this month?<br/>

                <strong>Response: </strong> I do not know about our process for delayed subscriptions.</li>
              <li><strong>Original Question: </strong>What features does your new line of products offer?<br/>

                <strong>Response: </strong> I do not know what features our new line of products does offer.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Why these are BAD responses: </strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li>(1) is incorrect as it does not start with one of the <strong>correct prefixes</strong>. <strong>Answers that do not start exactly with one of the correct prefixes will not be accepted!</strong></li>
              <li>(2) would seem to be a correct response to the question but it has added many extraneous words and phrases ('access information', 'of operation') and has kept very little of the original question in its response.</li>
              <li>(3) would seem to be correct as well but it has also added unnecessary words ('our process') and has changed the phrasing of the original question.</li>
              <li>(4) is incorrect as although it copies all the words from the original sentence and only moves 'does' to occur later, it sounds like a jarringly unnatural response as opposed to the one given in the good responses section.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>We try to do our best to pay turkers fairly, giving time to think about the task and submit reasonable responses. Individuals who try and exploit the task by submitting empty, incomplete, or lots of bad responses will NOT have their work approved. Don&#39;t worry about this if you are putting in a normal amount of thought/effort! We appreciate your help and please leave feedback if you have any thoughts or comments!</p>
